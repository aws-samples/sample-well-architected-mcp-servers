# EBS Volume Optimization

Analyze my EBS volumes for cost and performance optimization opportunities.

## Analysis Request

Please analyze my EBS volumes for optimization:

1. **Get EBS volume optimization recommendations**
   - Retrieve EBS volume recommendations from Cost Optimization Hub
   - Identify unused (unattached) EBS volumes for potential deletion
   - Show gp2 to gp3 migration opportunities for cost savings

2. **Analyze EBS volume costs and usage**
   - Show EBS storage costs by volume type and region
   - Identify highest cost volumes for optimization priority
   - Calculate potential savings from volume type migrations

3. **Check for performance optimization opportunities**
   - Find over-provisioned IOPS on io1/io2 volumes
   - Identify volumes with low utilization that can be downsized
   - Suggest optimal volume types based on usage patterns

## Expected Deliverables

- List of specific EBS volumes with optimization recommendations
- Unused volume identification with cost impact of deletion
- gp2 to gp3 migration opportunities with estimated savings
- Over-provisioned volume rightsizing recommendations
- Priority ranking based on cost savings potential

Focus on actionable recommendations with clear cost impact and minimal performance risk.
