# Lambda Function Optimization

Analyze my Lambda functions for memory allocation and cost optimization opportunities.

## Analysis Request

Please analyze my Lambda functions for optimization:

1. **Get Lambda function recommendations**
   - Retrieve Lambda memory optimization recommendations from Compute Optimizer
   - Show current vs recommended memory settings
   - Calculate cost impact of memory optimization

2. **Analyze Lambda costs and usage patterns**
   - Show Lambda costs by function and region over the last 30 days
   - Identify highest cost functions for optimization priority
   - Analyze invocation patterns and execution duration trends

3. **Check for optimization opportunities**
   - Find over-allocated memory (low memory utilization)
   - Identify functions with outdated runtime versions
   - Suggest architecture migration opportunities (x86 to ARM64)

## Expected Deliverables

- List of specific Lambda functions with memory optimization recommendations
- Current vs recommended memory settings with cost impact
- Runtime version upgrade recommendations for security and performance
- Architecture migration opportunities (x86 to ARM64) with savings estimates
- Priority ranking based on cost savings potential and implementation effort

Focus on actionable recommendations that reduce costs while maintaining or improving performance.
