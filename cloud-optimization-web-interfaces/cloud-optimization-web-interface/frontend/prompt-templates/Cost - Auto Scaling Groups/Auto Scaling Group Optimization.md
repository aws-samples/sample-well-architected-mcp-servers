# Auto Scaling Group Optimization

Analyze my Auto Scaling Groups for cost optimization opportunities and provide specific recommendations.

## Analysis Request

Please analyze my Auto Scaling Groups for cost savings:

1. **Get ASG rightsizing recommendations** from AWS Compute Optimizer
   - Show current ASG configurations and recommended optimizations
   - Identify oversized minimum capacity settings
   - Calculate potential cost savings from optimization

2. **Analyze ASG costs and scaling patterns**
   - Show ASG-related EC2 costs over the last 30 days
   - Identify ASGs with highest cost impact
   - Review scaling activities and capacity utilization

3. **Check for cost optimization opportunities**
   - Find ASGs with consistently low utilization
   - Identify Spot instance integration opportunities
   - Suggest instance type optimizations within ASGs

## Expected Deliverables

- List of specific ASGs with optimization recommendations
- Estimated monthly cost savings from implementing changes
- Spot instance integration opportunities with risk assessment
- Capacity optimization recommendations (min/max/desired settings)

Focus on practical recommendations that balance cost savings with application performance requirements.
